# NIH_F31_Grant
My NIH F31 grant from 2017. Can be used for a variety of purposes including use as an example for
content or formatting. This repository has been inspired by [Jean Fan's excellent example](http://jef.works/blog/2017/10/19/NIH-F-series-grant-tips-and-example/)
of an F31 grant. Her work is far better than mine, but I believed that I could provide a more comprehensive
set of documents than she was able to. There are many tips online for creating an F31, and I suggest to
read all of them if you desire a strong score.

In providing documentation examples I have also redacted information that may be personal or should not be shared. But, I
have tried to share as much as possible in hopes of the information being useful. In addition to standard grant materials, I
have also included "Just in Time" (JIT) materials as well given how I felt like the completion of this process was slightly
under-documented as well.
